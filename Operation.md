How CPU and GPU Work Together

They work together to increase the throughput of data and the number of concurrent calculations within an application.
GPUs were originally designed to create images for computer graphics and video game consoles, but since the early 2010â€™s, GPUs can also be used to accelerate calculations involving massive amounts of data.

A CPU can never be fully replaced by a GPU: a GPU complements CPU architecture by allowing repetitive calculations within an application to be run in parallel while the main program continues to run on the CPU.
